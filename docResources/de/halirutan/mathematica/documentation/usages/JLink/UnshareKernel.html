</h3>
<ul>
    <li>UnshareKernel[token] is used to "unregister" an earlier call to ShareKernel that returned the given token. When
        all calls to ShareKernel have had a corresponding call to UnshareKernel, kernel sharing is turned off and the
        front end returns to its normal state of having full control of the kernel. Turning off kernel sharing also
        stops execution of any periodical tasks established with AddPeriodical. UnshareKernel[linkobject] turns off all
        sharing of the kernel with the given link, no matter how many times ShareKernel has been called for that link
        (this form should only be used during development, not in production code). For backwards compatibility,
        UnshareKernel[] is equivalent to UnshareKernel[JavaLink[]], but new code should always include the link
        argument.
