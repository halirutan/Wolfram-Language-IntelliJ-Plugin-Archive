<h3><a href="http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/JLink/ref/JavaThrow.html">JavaThrow</a></h3>
<ul>
    <li>JavaThrow["exceptionClassName", "detailMsg"] causes the specified exception to be thrown in the Java thread that
        called the Mathematica program in which JavaThrow occurred. You can also call JavaThrow with an Exception object
        created by a call to JavaNew, instead of a string giving the name of the exception class. If you use the string
        form, the second argument is an optional detail message for the exception. It is up to the user to ensure that
        the exception being created has an appropriate constructor. JavaThrow is a specialized function that few
        programmers will have any use for.
