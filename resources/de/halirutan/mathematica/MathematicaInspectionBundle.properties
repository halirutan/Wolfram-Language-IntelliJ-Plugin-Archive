consistent.compound.expression.in.file.name=Missing semicolon at file-scope
consistent.compound.expression.in.file.description=At file scope it is considered good code-style, when all separate expressions are closed with a semicolon.
consistent.compound.expression.in.file.message=Missing semicolon
bugs.implicit.times.through.linebreak.name=Multiplication through linebreak
bugs.implicit.times.through.linebreak.description=This linebreak is interpreted as multiplication. When two complete expressions are separated by a linebreak, then Mathematica interprets this as a multiplication. This is probably not intended.
bugs.implicit.times.through.linebreak.message=Missing comma or semicolon
