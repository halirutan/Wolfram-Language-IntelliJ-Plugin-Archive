<ul>
    <li>FactorTermsList[<em>poly</em>] gives a list in which the first element is the overall numerical factor in <em>poly</em>,
        and the second element is the polynomial with the overall factor removed.

        }] gives a list of factors of <em>poly</em>. The first element in the list is the overall numerical factor. The
        second element is a factor that does not depend on any of the <em>x</em><sub><em>i</em></sub>. Subsequent
        elements are factors which depend on progressively more of the <em>x</em><sub><em>i</em></sub>.
