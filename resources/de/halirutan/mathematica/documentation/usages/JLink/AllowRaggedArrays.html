<h3><a href="http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/JLink/ref/AllowRaggedArrays.html">AllowRaggedArrays</a></h3>
<ul>
    <li>AllowRaggedArrays[True] lets you pass ragged (i.e., non-rectangular) arrays to Java. For example, a method that
        takes int[][] could be passed {{1,2},{3}}. AllowRaggedArrays[True] can drastically reduce the speed with which
        large arrays are passed back and forth between Mathematica and Java. Call AllowRaggedArrays[False] to restore
        the default behavior.
