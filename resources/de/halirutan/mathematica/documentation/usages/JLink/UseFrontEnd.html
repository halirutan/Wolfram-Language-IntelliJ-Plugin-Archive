<ul>
    <li>UseFrontEnd[expr] evaluates expr in an environment where the kernel can make use of the services of the notebook
        front end. The most important such service is producing images involving typeset expressions. The front end will
        be launched if required. This function will typically be called only from an external program that is driving
        the kernel, not from code executing in a front end notebook.
