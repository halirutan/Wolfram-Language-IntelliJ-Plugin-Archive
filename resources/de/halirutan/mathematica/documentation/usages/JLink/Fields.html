<ul>
    <li>Fields[javaclass] returns a list (in TableForm) of the Java declarations for all fields of the specified class.
        You can also specify a class by its name or an object of that class, as in Fields["java.net.URL"] or
        Fields[javaobject]. To make them easier to read, the declarations have had the keywords transient and volatile
        removed. The public keyword is also removed, as the fields are always public.
