<ul>
    <li>ImplementJavaInterface[interfaces, handlerMappings] uses the Dynamic Proxy facility of Java to create a new Java
        class and return an object of that class that implements the named interface or list of interfaces by calling
        back into Mathematica. In short, it lets you create a Java object that implements a given Java interface
        entirely in Mathematica code. The handlerMappings argument is a list of rules that specify the name of the Java
        method and the name of the method that will be called in Mathematica to implement the body of that method, as in
        "intfMeth1"->"mathHandlerMethod1". The arguments passed to the Mathematica method will be exactly the arguments
        originally passed to the Java method.
