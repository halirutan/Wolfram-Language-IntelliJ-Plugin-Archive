<h3><a href="http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/JLink/ref/JavaBlock.html">JavaBlock</a></h3>
<ul>
    <li>JavaBlock[expr] causes all new Java objects returned to Mathematica during the evaluation of expr to be released
        when expr finishes. It is an error to refer to such an object after JavaBlock ends. See the usage message for
        ReleaseJavaObject for more information. JavaBlock only affects new objects, not additional references to ones
        that have previously been seen. If a JavaBlock returns a single JavaObject as a result, that object will not be
        released. JavaBlock is a way to mark a set of objects as temporary so they can be automatically cleaned up when
        the block of code ends.
