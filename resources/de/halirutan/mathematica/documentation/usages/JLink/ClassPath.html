<ul>
    <li>ClassPath is an option to InstallJava that controls whether the Java runtime should include the contents of the
        CLASSPATH environment variable in its class search path. The default is ClassPath->Automatic, which means to
        include CLASSPATH. If you specify ClassPath->None, CLASSPATH will be ignored. You can also specify a string
        giving a classpath specification in the standard platform-specific notation. Users considering specifying a
        string as the value for the ClassPath option should probably use the more flexible AddToClassPath function
        instead. The main use for the ClassPath option is to set it to None, in case you want to specifically prevent
        J/Link from including the contents of the CLASSPATH variable in its search path.
